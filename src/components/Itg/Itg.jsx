			<p>I developed and designed this website for Ideas To Go from May 2021 - Oct 2021 as a freelance contractor. I no longer maintain the website, the contract ended upon completion of the build. It is hosted on Squarespace, and uses a custom theme I created. I was provided design assets including logos, fonts, and a color pallet. I worked with their Designer <a href="https://francesbarra.wixsite.com/mysite" target="_blank" id="frankie-link">Frances Barra</a> to implement page designs, and picked up so many skills throughout our communication as well as technical exposure. I learned a lot from the task of recreating detailed designs for the live website.</p>

			<p>I developed the entire website of 40+ pages, and utilized a combination of built in Squarespace features and my own custom CSS. The process of this project brought me many new ways of approaching a problem, and I learned the most from utilizing flexibility and researching and understanding process before delving deep into it. The most technical aspects of the website that I implemented are the angled and responsive page transitions, the custom CTA buttons, the contact form (embed from their CRM), and the responsive images.</p>
